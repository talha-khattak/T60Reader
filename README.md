# T60Reader
Reads the EEPROM of a Thinkpad T60/R60.

Full creddit to [aave](https://soltau.ru/index.php/remont-i-servis/itemlist/user/154-aave) on [soltau.ru](https://soltau.ru/index.php/remont-i-servis/item/550-kak-snyat-supervisor-password-noutbuka-thinkpad-t60-s-pomoshchyu-arduino) for the code. 

There was no .ino file on the site, and the embedded code had a few errors, so I just fixed it up and reformatted it without most of the comments. Use that site and [this one](http://www.ja.axxs.net/t60_t60p.htm) if you need to find the supervisor password of your T60. 

*Please do not use this on anything you don't own.*
